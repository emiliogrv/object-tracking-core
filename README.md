# ‚ùì About this project

This project is made in order to learn and put into practice my knowledge of Python and some AI models implementation, it was born as a personal project after asking myself how many cars pass by my window every day.

I implemented Object detection using YOLOv4 and object tracking using DeepSort and TensorFlow.

It'll work fine with images and videos files and URLs as well as videos streaming platforms like YouTube.

# üí° Getting Started

To see how this project works you have two options

### üü° Option 1: Online

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/emiliogrv/object-tracking-core/blob/main/opencv_yolo_deep_sort.ipynb)

### üü† Option 2: In local?

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download [YOLO weights](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4-tiny.weights) into **weights** folder.
3. Copy  `.env.example` to `.env`.
4. Run `docker-compose build`.
5. Run `docker-compose up`.
6. Open Postman or similar and make a POST to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/track-it`
7. Payload:
   ```json
    {
      "output_filename": "some_filename_here",
      "source": "your image or video URL here"
    }
      ```
8. Wait until terminal "processed" message.
9. Open **outputs** folder and see the result.

NOTE: By default, this will run only with CPU support.

# ‚ùó Troubleshooting

If you find any problem in my code or anything else, feel free to contact me, open an issue or do a pull request, that
way I can keep learning, and I can improve the code so that way anyone else can learn from it in the best way.
